# Murmurations

## Overview

Mumurations is a Silent Speech Interface project that regenerates audio from force sensor data. By utilizing commercially available sensors, the system non-invasively captures subtle micro-movements and vibrations during silent articulation. Machine learning techniques, including potential fine-tuning of models like Whisper, are employed to reconstruct intelligible speech from these mechanical signals. This repository contains the hardware designs, data collection protocols, and experimental setups aimed at creating a scalable, accessible alternative to traditional speech recognition systems.
